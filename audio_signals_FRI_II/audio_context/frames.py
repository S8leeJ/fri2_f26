# background -> background.py, for the noise floor
# speech     -> speech.py, for how loud the talking is

# A Buffer keeps the recent past of both piles in two SQLite files, so a
# module can look across seconds rather than one block at a time, and so you
# can open the stores and inspect them while it runs:
#
#   buf = Buffer("data", seconds=15.0, frame_sec=0.032)
#   buf.add(background, speech)
#   buf.background()   # every background frame in the buffer
#
# Frames of digital silence are dropped on the way in. A frame of exact
# zeros reads around -240 dB and is not a measurement of the room, so
# letting it into the store would drag the noise floor below anything a
# real room reaches.
